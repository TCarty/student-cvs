        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>From an early age I have always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.<br>

<br>This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.</br>

<br>The A-Levels I chose to study subjects that not really you would have related to the world of ICT, but made me understand the wide surroundings within the ICT industry. The interest and the passion for the subject has never left me from a very young age and i had the luck to have teachers within the my school who offered to sit with me and see what areas within I.T i would best enjoy and fit in with. That was when i discovered the world of computer science!. When moving to the different choices within compauter science i decided to stick to the basic computer science degree which covered all aspects with some detail. My passion for the subject when moving to university always grew, when learning new and exciting aspects within the subject i would research and practice the ideals. It got to a point later on within my learning that i really wanted to produce an "app" for a mobile phone product. At the time i was working for Papa Johns Pizza and had realised that they had not release a mobile application. I made this the basis for one of my projects within university and you will be able to see within the projects page how it came along.</br> 

<br>I am very hard working individual and have been working from a very young age. Since the age of 16 i have had some sort of job, whether it was a part time or full time during the summer. Working has always been apart of my life and i enjoy any position i would be put it. I believe its a very important aspect to every day life, if you dont enjoy what you're doing whats going to get you through the day, week and year! Regardless of what sort of job your doing you should always have a smile on your face. Since starting a new software testing course within Testing Circle my passion has only grown. You only seem to understand once your on a course that you learn something new everyday and i can say that proudly working with Testing circle. This course has broadened my horizons of the areas with producing software and the different processes an application has to go through before it is ready for release. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work within a major company and show the skills i have learned throughout my whole learning career.</p><br>
