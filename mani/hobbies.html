    <p>Most of the hobbies that i cater for are all some way involved with technology. In my spare time i cater to the elderly and have worked up a good business repor by repairing and setting up any technical device they would like me to. This all came along due to my interest in repairing and building my own compputers/laptops. I continue to do this in my spare time. I also like keeping fit so i am a regular member of my local gymnasium. I do enjoy my video games, and i have from a very young age but putting a little twist on that i do get involved in a lot of beta testing within gaming and also alpha testing. The most recent alpha test that i am involved with is the soon to be released EA Sports FIFA 15.</p><br>
    
    <p><br>I have always been interested with the world of sport, football more than others. This has been from a very young age as my family members were all in their football. I have been bought up to support my local team and by location i guess you know what that is! However i am also a keen follower of american sports especially the NFL. As of the time difference between the nations its very difficult to watch the games without having to record them but i did have the privilage of going to watch a couple of games on their UK tour. It is an experience that i will never forget.</p>
